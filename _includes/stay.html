      <p class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 text-center">We will be staying in Ravello (exact location tbd and to be updated here)- we recommend you do too. Buses and ferries can be used to get to other towns on the coast for visits. There are no shortage of places to stay in Ravello, however we recommend you book early. Ravello consists of two parts: main Ravello on the mountain and Ravello by the sea. We would not recommend staying in Ravello by the sea unless you want to climb 700 + very steep steps, or walk 7km to the wedding venue. Here are a few recommendations to get you started:</p>

      <p>Very near to the center of town, Graal Hotel offers excellent hillside views from their rooms and pool. About a 5 minute walk to the church and an 15 minute walk to the reception venue Graal Hotel offers convince that is lost with the hotels outside of town. Book directly and mention Gabriella and Chris' wedding to receive 10% off 3+ nights stay.</p>

      <p>A bit further away, but more spacious, Villa Piedimonte still offers spectacular views, great amenities, and a relaxing pool. An excellent choice but not for those who dislike uphill walks, it's about 15 minutes to the center of town and 25 minutes to the reception.</p>

        </div> 
        <p>Vacation rentals are the most affordable option on the coast, great for groups, and come in a variety of options like cozy apartments or large villas with a pool. TripAdvisor (we swear Gabriella doesn't get a cut!) and Airbnb have the most options in the area. Beware the that the terrain is hilly and the map deceptive. Places are further away in distance and elevation than they look! Many homes are 10+ flights of stairs from the main road. We recommend asking before booking.</p>
