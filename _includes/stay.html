      <h3 class="text-center">Vacation Rentals</h3>
      <p>Whether its a noble and stately villa overlooking the sea or an apartment tucked on a quiet side street in Ravello or one of the neighboring communities vacation rentals are a great option for finding places to stay along the Amalfi Coast. Especially if you're traveling with family or friends there's something comforting about coming back to a house at the end of the night, and this comfort often comes cheaper than a similar hotel. Sites like TripAdvisor and Home Away have great listings for properties in the area, we would recommend that you keep the hilly terrain of the region in mind. After all even a "short" walk up ten flights of stairs can be a lot to take on in the morning.</p>
