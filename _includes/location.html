      <h3 class="text-center">Capri</h3>
        <p>Just off of Sorrento and a short boat ride from Atrani or Amalfi lies the beautiful island of Capri. The island served as a retreat from Roman city life for the Emporor Tiberius who built numerous Villas on the island. The mainland now plays home to two small towns, Capri and Anacapri and offers hiking resturants and shopping. However what Capri is most famous for are the waters surronding it, you can journey by boat to see the White Grotto, or world famous Blue Grotto, as well as the picturesque Faraglioni.</p>
