            <p>Why venture away when there's so much at hand! Concert series and tours of the gardens at Villa Rufolo. The Wagner Gardens and Belvedere Terrace at Villa Chimbrone. Relax with a spritz in the piazza after wandering the small side alleys and local artisan shops. Or take a walk down to the seaside town of Atrani and lay out on the beach.</p>

            <p>With it's breathtaking coastal views and relatively undeveloped mountain sides the hiking along the Amalfi Coast is unrivaled. Sentiero degli dei, or Path of the Gods is the most famous hike between Bomerano and Positano, cutting through mountain gorges and skirting precarious cliffsides all while offering panoramic views of the mediteranian. Bomerano and Positano are reachable by buses, with connections in Amalfi.</p>

            <p>To the north of the Amalfi coast lie the ruins of the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Erculanum. Burried in ash after the erruption of Mt. Vesuvius these towns have been preserved for centuries giving you a glimpse at how Romans lived, as well as the horrible tragady. Pompeii is reachable by train from Sorrento or Napoli.</p>

            <p>Just off of Sorrento and a short boat ride from Atrani or Amalfi lies the beautiful island of Capri. The island served as a retreat from Roman city life for the Emporor Tiberius who built numerous Villas on the island. The island now plays home to two small towns, Capri and Anacapri and offers hiking resturants and shopping. However what Capri is most famous for are the waters surronding it, you can journey by boat to see the White Grotto, or world famous Blue Grotto, as well as the picturesque Faraglioni.</p>

            <p>From Naploli it's a short train ride to Caserta where Gabriella's parents are from. There in the former seat of the Kingdom of Naples is the Reggia di Caserta, home to the Bourbon kings of Naples during the Baroque era. Noted as one of the largest (47,000 square meters) and most beautiful palaces in the world and a perfect example of Baroque era opulence. The splendor of the palace inside is only matched by the 120 hectare park behind it, home to miniture castles and artifical ponds in which the princes would practice their land and naval warfare, as well as stunning fountains and botanical gardens.</p>

              <p>You haven't eaten pizza until you've eaten pizza in Italy, and while each region has their own specialty the Napolitano style with its thin crispy crust and delicious toppings is by far our favorite. Tucked away just off the town square Mimi makes up for their lack of a view with delicious food and rustic ambiance.</p>
