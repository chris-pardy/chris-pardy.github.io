					<p class="col-xs-12">Even though they are far away and don’t see each other much, Chiara and Gabriella have always been close cousins. Two years ago, Gabriella even had the amazing opportunity to be  Chiara's confirmation sponsor.  Although the younger cousin long ago surpassed Gabriella in height, Chiara is the obvious choice for junior bridesmaid.</p>

				<div class="item left-align row">
					<h2 class="col-xs-12">Katherine Shea <small>Bridesmaid</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">Katherine and Gabriella started off as co-workers, but truly bonded when they started commuting to work together after both moving to Beacon Hill. The 90+ minutes spent in the car each day was easily filled with talk of work, but mostly fashion and boys. Even now that both have left Vistaprint, they’ve still remained close friends, although Gabriella promises Chris that these days they just talk about fashion. Gabriella is happy to have Katherine as a bridesmaid.</p>

				<div class="item left-align row">
					<h2 class="col-xs-12">Emilie Rabehi <small>Bridesmaid</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">When Emilie’s job brought her to Boston she reached out to her co-worker Gabriella to get a local’s perspective on where to live. Gabriella helped Emilie navigate her new city discussing the merits of various neighborhoods (Beacon Hill is obviously the best). When Emilie moved into an apartment just down the street from Gabriella they quickly became friends. Gabriella is excited that Emilie will be travelling to Italy to be her bridesmaid.</p>

					<h2 class="col-xs-12" >Katherine Sultenfuss <small>Maid of Honor</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">Katherine and Gabriella became friends in high school and were inseparable, even sharing a locker. Over the years Katherine has always been there for Gabriella, , they've traveled the world together and stayed friends despite being so far away. Gabriella is thrilled that Katherine agreed to be her maid of honor.</p>

					<p class="col-xs-12">Stephen has been Chris's brother since he was born. In the intervening 25 years he has also been there as a traveling companion, fellow adventurer, Lego master builder, and occasional partner in crime. Chris knew that there was only one person that he could ever want to be his best man.</p>

				<div class="item right-align row">
					<h2 class="col-xs-12">Michael Addonisio <small>Groomsman</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">Michael is the sort of person who would loan you the shirt off his back or stick up for you in a fight. In short he's the kind of guy who you'd want with you if you get into trouble, but also the one who may have gotten you into trouble. Chris is excited to have Michael as a groomsmen but more importantly as a brother-in-law.</p>

					<h2 class="col-xs-12">Ben LaVerriere <small>Groomsman</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">First becoming friends during a college project in which all their other teammates dropped the class. Ben and Chris bonded over their love of theatre, food, and shared Maine heritage. Since then Ben's been an amazing friend, fellow cook, and beer connoisseur. Chris is happy that he can also now count Ben as a groomsman.</p>

					<h2 class="col-xs-12">Joseph Addonisio <small>Junior Groomsman</small></h2>
					<p class="col-xs-12">"You didn't to ask Joseph's permission?" was not the first thing that Gabriella said to Chris after he proposed to her, more like the fourth. After-all as Gabriella’s younger brother of 14 years, he’s used to being consulted on matters related to <strong>His Lella</strong>. Chris is thrilled that Joseph forgave him for this oversight and is joining him as a junior groomsman.</p>
