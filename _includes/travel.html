          <p>Napoli is the closest airport. Or let la dolce vita find you as you explore first. Flying into Roma's airport, Aeroporto Internazionale Leonardo da Vinci (FCO), will give you a chance to see the City of the Seven Hills. From there it is about 2 hours by train or car to reach Napoli.</p>

          <p>Trenitalia offers connections between all the major cities in Italy. To get to Ravello via public transportation take the Itercity or Regionale (40 minutes) train from the Naples Centrale Station to Salerno. From Salerno the SITA bus will take you to Ravello, but you will need to switch lines in Amalfi. Alternatively see information below for cab services from Salerno to Ravello.</p>
          <p>Bus tickets have to be bought in advance and can be found at caffè bars and Tabacchi. Schedules are available online from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en" data-track-event="click" data-track-label="trenitalia">Trenitalia</a> and <a target="_new" href="http://www.sitasudtrasporti.it/orari" data-track-event="click" data-track-label="sita sud">SITA&nbsp;SUD</a>.</p>

          <p>You can pick up a rental car at any airport and the highways in Italia are easy enough. However, driving the Amalfi coast while beautiful is narrow and terrifying. Also the towns on the coast are mostly car free; parking is limited and can only be found on the outskirts of town. We advise that you avoid driving the coast and ditch the car in Napoli if possible.</p>
          <p>If you want to splurge, a car service from Napoli to Ravello is €100-150 each way.

          <p>The closest ferry port to Ravello is in Amalfi. From there you can get a ferry to Capri, Positano, Sorrento, Salerno, or Ischia. Sorrento and Salerno also have connections on to Napoli and other cities. Ferries come less frequently than buses, but we understand if you cannot resist the call of the sea.</p>
