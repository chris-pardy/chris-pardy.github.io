  			<p>Napoli is the closest airport. Or let adventures and la dolce vita find you as you explore Bella Italia first. Flying into Roma's airport, Fiumicino&nbsp;–&nbsp;Aeroporto Internazionale Leonardo da Vinci (FCO), will give you a chance to see the City of the Seven Hills. After you're done exploring it is about 2 hours by train or car to reach Napoli.</p>

  			<p>You can pick up a rental car at any airpot and the highways in Italia are easy enough. However, the drive along the Amalfi coast is beautiful, narrow, winding, and terrifying. We advise that you ditch the car in Napoli and avoid driving the coast if possible. However if you do decide to drive we'd recomend you rent a small Italian car as it will be easier to park.</p>
        <p>If you want to splurge, a car service from Napoli to Ravello is $100-130 each way.</p>

        <p>Hydrofoils provide ferry service between towns along the Amalfi Coast and occasionally from Sorrento and Napoli. Generally ferries will be less convinent than busses, but we understand if you cannot resist the call of the sea.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Vacation Rentals</h3>
      <p>Whether its a noble and stately villa overlooking the sea or an apartment tucked on a quiet side street in Ravello or one of the neighboring communities vacation rentals are a great option for finding places to stay along the Amalfi Coast. Especially if you're traveling with family or friends there's something comforting about coming back to a house at the end of the night, and this comfort often comes cheaper than a similar hotel. Sites like TripAdvisor and Home Away have great listings for properties in the area, we would recomend that you keep the hilly terrain of the region in mind. After all even a "short" walk up ten flights of stairs can be a lot to take on in the morning.</p>
