		<p class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">It all started in 2012 when two coworkers took a business trip to the Netherlands to launch a product. She was the product owner and he was the lead developer. Getting on the airplane they were mistaken for a couple - clearly a sign of things to come. While exploring Amsterdam together, they started talking and realized that they shared a love of food, cooking, company, and exploring old European cities. After coming back home they stayed friends, and even hosted a few dinner parties. Finally 6 months later Chris got up the nerve to tell Gabriella how he felt and send her an email. After 2 weeks without a response Chris couldn't help but feel disappointed not realizing that Gabriella was in Italy and completely detached from the web. On her first day back in the office there was a painfully awkward meeting (well, for him; she still hadn't checked her email). Finally that night she read the momentous email and later that week they had dinner, drinks, and laughs. On one of their first dates, after dinner, they went out to the Esplanade and sitting on a park bench overlooking the Charles River and watching the sail boats they decided to make it official.</p>
		<p class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">After about 540 nights of having dinner together Chris knew he wanted to keep doing so for the rest of their lives. He asked her dad, picked out a ring, and then concocted an elaborate plan complete with a pretend startup called Platinum Vermillion that provided "bespoke adventures". Clues were texted to the couple throughout the night which they had to decode to see how their adventure would unfold. After decoding a book cipher they were lead to dinner and drinks. The next clue was a map of the Esplanade that pointed them to the very same park bench where they started dating. There in the freezing cold, with Gabriella huddled like an Eskimo, Chris got down on one knee and popped the question.</p>
		<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">Of course she said yes, and now the couple can't wait to take all their family and friends to Italy, the country of amore to celebrate their union.</p>
